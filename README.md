## 🔐 Secure P2P Encrypted Chat Application

A **secure peer-to-peer encrypted chat application** designed to protect user privacy and ensure confidential communication.  
The system focuses on **data security, user authentication, and message confidentiality**, providing a private messaging experience without centralized message storage.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔒 **End-to-End Message Encryption**
- 🛡️ **Secure Peer-to-Peer Communication**
- 🔑 **Access Code–Based Authentication**
- 👤 **Username-Based Identity System**
- 🟢 **Real-Time Connection Status**
- 🖥️ **Simple and Intuitive Graphical Interface**
- ❌ **No Message Logging or Storage**

---

## 🧠 Security Concept

This application is built with a **security-first design philosophy**:

- Messages are **encrypted before transmission**
- Only authenticated peers can establish communication
- Encryption keys are never stored permanently
- Message content is accessible **only to the sender and the receiver**
- No third party can read or intercept message data

All communications occur in **private, isolated sessions**, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of exchanged messages.

---

## 🔑 Access Code Mechanism

The **Access Code** functions as a shared secret between users:

- Prevents unauthorized access
- Validates peer identity before connection
- Ensures both parties belong to the same secure session

Only users with the correct access code can communicate.
